class vfind:
    var=10
object1 = vfind()
print('Here is the class variable-->',object1.var)

'''I just made a class and given the name as "vfind" and then I made a class variable name as "var"  then
I  created an Object to access the class variable  and you see I used the syntax to access the class
variable with the help  dot(.) operator ----> (OBJECT.CLASS VARIABLE) and in classes we can access the 
class variable + class methods(FUNCTIONS) also and after combining them we can say they are "CLASS MEMBERS"
